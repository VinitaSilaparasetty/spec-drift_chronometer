# Product Strategy: Spec-Drift Chronometer

## Vision
The Spec-Drift Chronometer is an **Autonomous Intent Guardian** designed to solve the $2.4T AI-generated tech-debt crisis. It transforms the IDE from a simple code-generator into a governed, production-grade innovation engine.

## Core Features
- **Active Spec Memory**: A living Intent Ledger in DynamoDB that keeps architectural context active across all sessions.
- **Semantic Drift Detection**: A background process that identifies intent deviations rather than just syntax changes.
- **Justification Gate**: An Agent-to-Agent negotiation protocol (Warden vs. Coder) using the Strands SDK.
- **Autonomous Spec Sync**: A pipeline that updates the 'Living Architecture' only after verified architectural justifications are logged.

## Strategic Impact
By enforcing architectural alignment at the moment of creation, the Chronometer ensures that AI velocity does not result in an unmaintainable "Ghost Codebase."
