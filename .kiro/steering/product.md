# Product Strategy: Spec-Drift Chronometer (Sovereign Edition)

## 1. Vision
The Spec-Drift Chronometer is an **Autonomous Intent Guardian** designed to solve the $2.4T AI-generated tech-debt crisis. It transforms the IDE from a simple code-generator into a governed, production-grade innovation engine that adheres to the **EU AI Act (2024/1689)** by design.

## 2. Core Pillars
* **Active Spec Memory (The Intent Ledger):** A living record in **Amazon DynamoDB** that maintains architectural context across sessions, preventing "context collapse."
* **Sovereign Drift Detection:** Utilizing a tiered reasoning model (**Amazon Nova Lite/Pro**) to identify semantic intent deviations rather than just syntax errors.
* **The Justification Gate:** A high-reasoning Agent-to-Agent negotiation protocol that forces AI coders to justify "spec-breaking" changes before they reach the main branch.
* **Autonomous Spec Sync:** A verifiable pipeline that updates the 'Living Architecture' only after human-verified architectural justifications are cryptographically logged.

## 3. Strategic Impact (The "Why")
By enforcing architectural alignment at the moment of creation, the Chronometer ensures that AI velocity does not result in an unmaintainable "Ghost Codebase." It provides:
* **For Developers:** 10x velocity without the fear of "breaking the system."
* **For Architects:** Automated enforcement of technical laws (e.g., Data Sovereignty in `eu-central-1`).
* **For Compliance Officers:** A real-time, immutable audit trail for AI-governed decisions.

## 4. Competitive Advantage
Unlike standard "AI Autocompletes," the Chronometer is **Network-Aware** via the **MCP Fetch Server**, allowing it to reconcile local code against real-time regulatory updates.
